educational usage

## features

I used some features such as:

1- intersection observer
2- scroll into
3- for each
4- query selector
5- append
6- getAttribute

## learned

what I learned in this project is how to fix some problems, how to really make what goes in my mind true. I found it hard to apply what I have in mind and to find the best code for it, but at last I managed to learn more and increase my knowledge.
